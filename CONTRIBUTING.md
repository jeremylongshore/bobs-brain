```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash

python -m pytest --cov=src tests/

# Run integration tests
python scripts/testing/test_complete_flow.py
```

### Writing Tests

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-end tests**: Test complete user workflows

Example test structure:
```python
import pytest
from src.bob_brain_v5 import BobBrain

class TestBobBrain:
    def test_process_message_valid_input(self):
        """Test message processing with valid input."""
        bob = BobBrain()
        result = bob.process_message("Hello Bob")
        assert result is not None
        assert len(result) > 0

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_slack_integration(self):
        """Test Slack integration functionality."""
        # Test implementation
        pass
```
