Also getting P0088 fuel rail pressure too high \n        intermittently. Classic CP4 pump failure symptoms. The CP4.2 pump part number is \n        BC3Z-9A543-B and costs about $3800 from Ford. We're also seeing metal shavings in \n        the fuel system which means we need to replace all injectors, part number BC3Z-9H529-B, \n        that's another $3200. Total repair with labor is going to be around $8500. This is \n        why we recommend a CP3 conversion kit for about $3500 total.\n        ",
