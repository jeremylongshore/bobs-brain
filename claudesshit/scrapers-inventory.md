## Potential Redundancies & Cleanup Candidates

### üî¥ **High Priority for Review/Removal**

1. **skidsteer_scraper.py** (36KB)
   - Very specific to Bobcat S740
   - Large codebase for narrow use case
   - Functionality may be covered by other scrapers

2. **forum_scraper.py** (59KB)
   - Extremely large and complex
   - May be over-engineered for current needs
   - Playwright dependency adds complexity

### üü° **Medium Priority for Review**

3. **unified_scraper_simple.py** vs **unified_scraper_api.py**
   - Potential duplication of functionality
   - Keep API version, evaluate if simple version is needed

4. **neo4j_unified_scraper.py** vs **scraper_neo4j_router.py**
   - Both handle Neo4j integration
   - May be consolidatable

### ‚úÖ **Definitely Keep**

- **circle_of_life_scraper.py** - Core learning system
- **tsb_scraper.py** - Official data source
- **youtube_equipment_scraper.py** - Good knowledge source
- **unified_scraper_api.py** - API interface
- **scraper_cloud_run.py** - Deployment infrastructure

## Recommendations

1. **Remove or significantly simplify** the two largest scrapers (forum + skidsteer)
2. **Consolidate** Neo4j integration into single component
3. **Choose one** unified scraper approach (API vs simple)
4. **Focus on** the core learning loop and essential data sources

**Potential Code Reduction**: ~100KB (50% reduction) by removing redundant/over-engineered components
