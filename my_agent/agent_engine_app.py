"""
Bob's Brain - Agent Engine Entrypoint for ADK Deployment

This file is REQUIRED by the 'adk deploy agent_engine' command.

When deploying with:
    adk deploy agent_engine my_agent \
      --project bobs-brain-dev \
      --region us-central1 \
      --staging_bucket gs://bobs-brain-dev-adk-staging

ADK CLI will:
1. Find this file (agent_engine_app.py by default, or via --adk_app flag)
2. Import the 'app' variable (must be a Runner instance)
3. Package everything into a Docker container
4. Upload to staging bucket
5. Deploy to Vertex AI Agent Engine

Enforces:
- R1: Uses google-adk (LlmAgent + Runner)
- R2: Designed for Vertex AI Agent Engine runtime
- R5: Dual memory wiring (Session + Memory Bank)
- R7: SPIFFE ID propagation
