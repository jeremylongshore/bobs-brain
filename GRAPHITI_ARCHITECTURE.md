## WHERE MACHINE LEARNING LIVES

### 1. **BigQuery ML** - Train models on your data
```sql
-- Models live IN BigQuery
CREATE MODEL `bobs-house-ai.ml_models.price_predictor`
OPTIONS(model_type='linear_reg') AS
SELECT * FROM scraped_data.repair_quotes;
```

### 2. **Vertex AI** - Advanced ML models
```python
# Models deployed to Vertex AI endpoints
from google.cloud import aiplatform

model = aiplatform.Model(
    model_name="projects/bobs-house-ai/models/repair-analyzer"
)
```

### 3. **Graphiti Connects to ML**
```python
class GraphitiWithML:
    def __init__(self):
        # Graphiti is the brain
        self.graphiti = Graphiti(neo4j_connection)
        
        # ML connections
        self.bigquery = bigquery.Client()  # For ML models
        self.vertex = aiplatform.init()    # For predictions
    
    async def think(self, question):
        # 1. Search knowledge graph
        context = await self.graphiti.search(question)
        
        # 2. Get ML predictions from BigQuery
        ml_prediction = self.bigquery.query("""
            SELECT * FROM ML.PREDICT(
                MODEL `ml_models.price_predictor`,
                (SELECT * FROM input_data)
            )
        """)
        
        # 3. Combine knowledge + ML
        return enhanced_response
```

## DO YOU NEED MCP?

### Short Answer: **NO** (for now)

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is for:
- Connecting to external tools
- IDE integrations
- Third-party services

**You DON'T need MCP because:**
1. âœ… Graphiti already connects to Neo4j directly
2. âœ… BigQuery ML is native Google Cloud
3. âœ… Vertex AI is native Google Cloud
4. âœ… Everything is in your cloud already

**You MIGHT want MCP later for:**
- Connecting to external APIs
- Adding Slack as MCP server
- Integrating with other tools

## THE COMPLETE FLOW

### 1. Data Ingestion
```
Web Scraping â†’ Firestore â†’ BigQuery â†’ Graphiti
                  â†“           â†“          â†“
              Real-time    Analytics  Knowledge
```

### 2. Machine Learning
```
BigQuery Data â†’ Train Model â†’ Deploy to Vertex â†’ Graphiti Uses It
```

### 3. Bob Responds
```
User Question â†’ Graphiti Searches â†’ Finds Context
                        â†“
                  Gets ML Predictions
                        â†“
                  Combines Everything
                        â†“
                  Intelligent Response
```

## ACTUAL CODE EXAMPLE

```python
# This is what Bob does internally
async def process_with_ml(question):
    # 1. GRAPHITI searches knowledge
    knowledge = await graphiti.search(question)
    
    # 2. BIGQUERY provides ML predictions
    ml_result = bigquery.query("""
        SELECT predicted_price 
        FROM ML.PREDICT(MODEL `price_model`, ...)
    """)
    
    # 3. VERTEX AI generates response
    response = vertex_model.generate(
        prompt=f"{knowledge} + {ml_result}"
    )
    
    # 4. Store learning back in GRAPHITI
    await graphiti.add_episode(response)
    
    return response
```

## WHERE EVERYTHING LIVES

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Graphiti** | Neo4j on GCP VM (10.128.0.2) | Knowledge graph brain |
| **ML Models** | BigQuery + Vertex AI | Predictions & analysis |
| **Raw Data** | BigQuery tables | Training data |
| **Real-time** | Firestore | Customer submissions |
| **Intelligence** | Vertex AI (Gemini) | Natural language |
| **Bob** | Cloud Run | Orchestrates everything |

## SIMPLE TRUTH

**Graphiti doesn't STORE the ML models.**
**Graphiti CONNECTS to them:**

1. ML models live in BigQuery/Vertex
2. Data lives in BigQuery/Firestore  
3. Graphiti creates RELATIONSHIPS between them
4. Bob uses Graphiti to ACCESS everything

Think of Graphiti as the **nervous system** connecting:
- Brain (ML models)
- Memory (databases)
- Senses (data ingestion)
- Speech (Slack responses)
