## 📋 GITHUB DOCUMENTATION & DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### 🔴 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES (MUST FOLLOW):
```bash
# NEVER commit directly to main branch
git checkout -b feature/alice-cloud-run-deployment
git checkout -b feature/bob-migration-documentation
git checkout -b feature/diagnosticpro-rollout-prep

# ALWAYS run safety checks:
make lint-check
make test
pre-commit run --all-files
make safe-commit

# NO --no-verify flag usage (bypasses safety)
```

### GitHub Documentation Tasks:
1. **Create Feature Branches**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/bob-migration-complete
   git checkout -b feature/alice-integration-ready
   git checkout -b feature/diagnosticpro-rollout
   ```

2. **Document Current State**:
   - **Bob's Migration**: Complete technical documentation
   - **Alice Strategy**: Cloud Run deployment guide
   - **Cost Analysis**: Detailed savings report
   - **System Architecture**: Firestore Native setup
   - **Performance Benchmarks**: Sub-100ms query times

3. **Update Repository Structure**:
   ```
   /bob_brain_migration/
   ├── README.md (Migration overview)
   ├── docs/
   │   ├── migration-report.md
   │   ├── alice-deployment-guide.md
   │   ├── cost-optimization.md
   │   └── system-architecture.md
   ├── scripts/
   │   ├── bob_firestore_tools.py
   │   ├── alice_integration_strategy.py
   │   └── enhanced_bob_tools.py
   └── tests/
       └── final_system_test.py
   ```

4. **Safety Workflow**:
   - All commits via feature branches
   - Mandatory lint/test passes
   - Pre-commit hooks active
   - Detailed commit messages
   - Pull request reviews required
