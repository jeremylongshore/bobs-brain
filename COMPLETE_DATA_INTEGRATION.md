## 📊 Integrated Datasets

### 1. BigQuery Datasets (Data Warehouse)
| Dataset | Purpose | Tables | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| **customer_submissions** | Website form data | diagnostics | ✅ Enhanced schema (70+ fields) |
| **mvp3_migrated** | Migrated Datastore | diagnostics | ✅ Ready for migration |
| **conversations** | Bob's chat history | history, corrections | ✅ Active |
| **scraped_data** | 40+ sources | unified_content, forums, youtube | ✅ Active |
| **circle_of_life** | ML learning | diagnostic_insights, patterns | ✅ Active |
| **knowledge_graph** | Neo4j views | equipment_relationships, customer_journey | ✅ Created |

### 2. Neo4j Aura (Knowledge Graph)
| Node Type | Relationships | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Customer** | SUBMITTED→Diagnostic | Track customer interactions |
| **Equipment** | ←ABOUT←Diagnostic | Equipment problem history |
| **Diagnostic** | →SIMILAR_TO→ | Find related issues |
| **Knowledge** | →MENTIONS→Equipment | Scraped content links |
| **Conversation** | →CONTAINS→Entity | Chat entity extraction |

### 3. Datastore (Legacy Support)
- **Project:** diagnostic-pro-mvp
- **Kind:** diagnostic_submissions
- **Status:** Maintained for backward compatibility
- **Migration:** Ready to migrate to BigQuery

## 🔌 Integration Points

### Website Form → BigQuery
```python
# Endpoint: /submit-diagnostic
# Process:
1. Receive form data
2. Validate fields
3. Get AI analysis (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
4. Store in BigQuery (customer_submissions.diagnostics)
5. Backward compatible store in Datastore
6. Send to Neo4j for graph storage
7. Trigger async processing
```

### BigQuery ↔ Neo4j Sync
```python
# Bidirectional sync every 4 hours
# BigQuery → Neo4j:
- Customer submissions
- Scraped knowledge
- Conversations

# Neo4j → BigQuery:
- Equipment patterns
- Customer patterns
- Solution effectiveness
```

### Enhanced Schema Features
```sql
-- Customer Website Intake (New Fields)
customer_name, customer_email, customer_phone
customer_company, customer_type (individual/business/fleet)
customer_location_city, state, country, zip
fleet_size, industry_type, annual_revenue

-- Website Tracking
session_id, ip_address, user_agent
landing_page, pages_visited[]
utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign
form_completion_time, abandoned_form

-- Service Details
service_type (repair/maintenance/consultation)
urgency_level (emergency/urgent/scheduled)
preferred_date, preferred_time
budget_range, payment_method

-- AI/ML Fields
confidence_score, ml_predictions
sentiment_score, priority_score
churn_risk_score, lead_score

-- Outcomes
solution_successful, nps_score
resolution_time, first_contact_resolution
lifetime_value, conversion_value
```

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### 1. Run Datastore to BigQuery Migration
```bash
python3 src/datastore_to_bigquery_migration.py
```

### 2. Deploy Website Form Integration
```bash
gcloud run deploy website-form-integration \
  --source . \
  --region us-central1 \
  --set-env-vars "PROJECT_ID=bobs-house-ai"
```

### 3. Setup Neo4j-BigQuery Sync
```bash
python3 src/neo4j_bigquery_sync.py
```

### 4. Update Circle of Life to Use BigQuery
```python
# Change in circle_of_life.py:
# FROM: datastore.Client(project=self.mvp_project)
# TO: Read from BigQuery mvp3_migrated.diagnostics
```

### 5. Create API Endpoints in Bob Brain
```python
@app.route("/submit-diagnostic", methods=["POST"])
@app.route("/customer-webhook", methods=["POST"])
@app.route("/check-status/<submission_id>", methods=["GET"])
```

## 🔍 Query Examples

### BigQuery Analytics
```sql
-- Top problems by equipment
SELECT
    equipment_type,
    problem_category,
    COUNT(*) as frequency,
    AVG(confidence_score) as avg_confidence
FROM `bobs-house-ai.customer_submissions.diagnostics`
GROUP BY equipment_type, problem_category
ORDER BY frequency DESC;

-- Customer lifetime value
SELECT
    customer_email,
    COUNT(*) as submissions,
    SUM(conversion_value) as total_value,
    AVG(nps_score) as avg_nps
FROM `bobs-house-ai.customer_submissions.diagnostics`
GROUP BY customer_email
HAVING submissions > 1;
```

### Neo4j Graph Queries
```cypher
// Find similar problems
MATCH (d1:Diagnostic)-[:ABOUT]->(e:Equipment)<-[:ABOUT]-(d2:Diagnostic)
WHERE d1.id = 'submission_id'
RETURN d2.description, d2.ai_analysis
ORDER BY d2.confidence DESC
LIMIT 5;

// Customer equipment history
MATCH (c:Customer {email: 'customer@email.com'})-[:SUBMITTED]->(d:Diagnostic)-[:ABOUT]->(e:Equipment)
RETURN e.type, COUNT(d) as problem_count
ORDER BY problem_count DESC;
```

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

- **GDPR Fields**: data_consent, gdpr_compliant tracking
- **PII Protection**: Encrypted storage, access controls
- **Audit Trail**: All changes tracked with timestamps
- **Data Retention**: Configurable per customer type

## 📊 Monitoring & Health

### Health Check Endpoints
- `/health` - Overall system health
- `/sync/status` - Neo4j-BigQuery sync status
- `/submission/<id>` - Check specific submission

### Key Metrics
- Submission processing time
- AI confidence scores
- Sync lag between systems
- Customer satisfaction (NPS)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy website form integration**
2. **Run initial data migration**
3. **Setup scheduled syncs**
4. **Update website forms with new fields**
5. **Configure monitoring dashboards**
