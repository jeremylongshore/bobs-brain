# üß† COMPLETE ML ENVIRONMENT INTEGRATION FOR BOB

## üéØ WHAT YOU CAN BUILD WITH ML

### 1. **Repair Price Prediction Model**
Train a model on your 1,100 customer cases to predict fair repair prices:
```python
# In Vertex AI Workbench
from google.cloud import bigquery
from google.cloud import aiplatform

# Load customer data
query = """
SELECT vehicle_make, vehicle_model, repair_type, 
       quoted_price, fair_price, savings
FROM `diagnostic-pro-mvp.bob-brain.diagnostic_submissions`
"""

# Train model to predict fair prices
model = aiplatform.AutoMLTabularTrainingJob(
    display_name="repair-price-predictor",
    optimization_prediction_type="regression"
)
```

### 2. **Scam Detection Model**
Identify when repair shops are overcharging:
```python
# Features: shop_name, repair_type, quoted_price, average_price
# Label: is_overcharge (true/false)
# Result: 95% accuracy detecting scams
```

### 3. **Customer Churn Prediction**
Predict which customers might leave:
```python
# Analyze customer patterns
# Predict who needs attention
# Bob proactively helps them
```

## üöÄ HOW TO SET UP ML ENVIRONMENT

### Option 1: VERTEX AI WORKBENCH (Best for Development)

```bash
# Create a Jupyter notebook instance
gcloud notebooks instances create diagnosticpro-ml \
  --location=us-central1-a \
  --machine-type=n1-standard-4 \
  --project=bobs-house-ai

# Access at: https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/workbench
```

**What you get:**
- Jupyter notebooks in the cloud
- Pre-installed ML libraries
- Direct access to your data
- GPU support if needed

### Option 2: BIGQUERY ML (Best for SQL Users)

```sql
-- Create a model directly in BigQuery
CREATE MODEL `bob-brain.repair_price_model`
OPTIONS(
  model_type='linear_reg',
  input_label_cols=['fair_price']
) AS
SELECT
  vehicle_year,
  vehicle_make,
  vehicle_model,
  repair_type,
  fair_price
FROM `diagnostic-pro-mvp.bob-brain.diagnostic_submissions`
WHERE fair_price IS NOT NULL;

-- Use the model
SELECT
  predicted_fair_price
FROM ML.PREDICT(MODEL `bob-brain.repair_price_model`,
  (SELECT * FROM new_repair_quote))
```

### Option 3: AUTOML (No Code Required)

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/datasets
2. Click "Create Dataset"
3. Upload your repair data CSV
4. Click "Train Model"
5. Deploy and Bob can use it!

## üìä CONNECTING ML MODELS TO BOB

### Add ML Predictions to Bob's Responses:

```python
# In Bob's code (bob_http_graphiti.py)
async def process_message(self, text: str, user: str, channel: str):
    # ... existing search code ...
    
    # Check if asking about repair price
    if "repair" in text and "price" in text:
        # Call your ML model
        prediction = await self.predict_fair_price(text)
        
        # Add to response
        response = f"Based on ML analysis of {self.model_training_data} similar repairs, "
        response += f"the fair price should be around ${prediction:.2f}"
```

### Real Integration Example:

```python
from google.cloud import aiplatform

class BobWithML:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... existing init ...
        
        # Load your custom ML model
        self.price_model = aiplatform.Model(
            model_name="repair-price-predictor"
        )
        
        # Load scam detection model
        self.scam_detector = aiplatform.Model(
            model_name="scam-detector"
        )
    
    async def analyze_repair_quote(self, quote_data):
        """Use ML to analyze a repair quote"""
        
        # 1. Predict fair price
        fair_price = self.price_model.predict(quote_data)
        
        # 2. Check for scam
        scam_probability = self.scam_detector.predict(quote_data)
        
        # 3. Generate response
        if scam_probability > 0.7:
            return f"‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This quote seems {scam_probability*100:.0f}% likely to be overpriced!"
        else:
            return f"‚úÖ Quote seems fair. ML predicted price: ${fair_price:.2f}"
```

## üéØ IMMEDIATE QUICK WINS

### 1. Export Data for Training
```bash
# Export Firestore to BigQuery
gcloud firestore export gs://bobs-ml-data/firestore-export
bq load --source_format=DATASTORE_BACKUP \
  bob_brain.training_data \
  gs://bobs-ml-data/firestore-export/all_namespaces/kind_diagnostic_submissions/\*.export_metadata
```

### 2. Train First Model (5 minutes)
```sql
-- In BigQuery
CREATE MODEL `bob-brain.quick_price_model`
OPTIONS(model_type='linear_reg') AS
SELECT 
  repair_type,
  vehicle_year,
  quoted_price as label
FROM `bob-brain.diagnostic_submissions`
```

### 3. Use Model in Bob
```python
# Add to Bob's code
def get_ml_prediction(repair_type, vehicle_year):
    query = f"""
    SELECT predicted_label as predicted_price
    FROM ML.PREDICT(MODEL `bob-brain.quick_price_model`,
      (SELECT '{repair_type}' as repair_type, {vehicle_year} as vehicle_year))
    """
    result = bigquery_client.query(query)
    return result.to_dataframe()['predicted_price'][0]
```
