## 💡 WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT

Based on git history and timestamps:

### 3:00 AM - 3:30 AM (October 7)
**You (with Claude) deployed:**
1. ✅ Midnight Blue color theme
2. ✅ Updated Hero component with honest copy
3. ✅ Removed false marketing claims
4. ✅ Added professional positioning
5. ✅ Committed and pushed to git
6. ✅ Deployed to Firebase Hosting

**Result:** Live at https://diagnosticpro.io by 3:24 AM

### What Was NOT Deployed
- Custom graphics (hero images, icons)
- User dashboard interface
- Advanced design system components
- Media capture interfaces

**Why:** These exist as PRDs (planning documents) but haven't been coded yet.

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS OPTIONS

### Option A: Continue with New Graphics
If you want to add new hero images, icons, and visual assets:
- I have a complete task list ready
- 2-3 hours to deploy new hero image
- 4-6 hours for comprehensive graphics update

### Option B: Implement Design System PRDs
If you want to build the advanced features from the PRDs:
- User dashboard with diagnostic history
- Media capture interfaces (video/camera/audio)
- Advanced form system
- 568 tasks broken down and ready

### Option C: Something Else You Remember
Tell me what specific design work you're thinking of, and I'll help locate or implement it.

## 🔍 SEARCH RESULTS

I searched for:
- [x] Git commits from last 48 hours - Found Midnight Blue deployment
- [x] Modified files in last 24 hours - Only Hero.tsx changed today
- [x] Stash entries - None found
- [x] Deleted branches - None found
