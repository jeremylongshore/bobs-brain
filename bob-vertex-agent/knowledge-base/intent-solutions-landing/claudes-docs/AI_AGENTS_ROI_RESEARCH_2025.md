## 6. CRITICAL WARNINGS & FAILURE RATES

### High Failure Rate in Agentic AI
- **40%+ cancellation rate**: Gartner predicts over 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by end of 2027
- **Reasons for failure**: Escalating costs, unclear business value, inadequate risk controls
- **Root cause**: Most agentic AI projects are early-stage experiments driven by hype and misapplication

### Current Capability Limitations
- **Carnegie Mellon study**: The best-performing AI agent (Gemini 2.5 Pro) completed only 30.3% of office tasks autonomously
- **Gartner analysis**: Only about 130 vendors out of thousands claiming agentic solutions actually offer genuine agentic capabilities (majority engage in "agent washing")
- **Real production deployment**: Most agentic AI propositions lack significant value or ROI due to lack of maturity to achieve complex business goals autonomously

### Adoption Reality vs. Expectations
- **Only 19% significant investment**: January 2025 Gartner poll shows only 19% of 3,412 organizations made significant investments in agentic AI
- **42% conservative**: 42% took conservative investment approach
- **31% waiting or unsure**: Remaining organizations taking wait-and-see approach
- **Only 20% seeing earnings**: Only 20% of businesses reported earnings benefits from AI in 2024 despite billions invested (Forrester)

### Change Management Requirements
- **Not just deployment**: Measurable productivity gains often require change management and process redesign, not just model deployment
- **Hard to capture metrics**: ROI remains difficult to capture without clear metrics, governance, and workforce reskilling

## 8. KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ROI VALIDATION

When evaluating AI agent ROI claims, verify:

1. **Time Period**: Statistics should be from 2024-2025 only (AI capabilities change rapidly)
2. **Sample Size**: Prefer research with multiple case studies or large sample sizes
3. **Methodology**: Understand study design (experimental vs. observational)
4. **Source Credibility**:
   - Tier 1: Gartner, McKinsey, Forrester, Nielsen Norman Group, Stanford HAI, academic institutions
   - Tier 2: Industry-specific research organizations
   - Tier 3: Vendor case studies (always inflate results)
5. **Context**: ROI depends heavily on:
   - Implementation quality
   - Process redesign
   - Change management
   - Clear governance
   - Proper metrics

## 9. FLAGS FOR EXAGGERATED CLAIMS

**Red Flags - Be Skeptical Of:**
- Claims without cited sources or research papers
- ROI projections without time horizon specified
- Statistics from vendor marketing materials only
- Single data point vs. multiple validating studies
- Claims about autonomous complex business tasks (current capability is 30-35% success rate)
- Promises of immediate ROI without change management mention
- "AI will replace humans" claims (successful implementations augment, not replace)
