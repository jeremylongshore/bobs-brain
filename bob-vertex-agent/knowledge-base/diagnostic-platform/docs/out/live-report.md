# DiagnosticPro Report

Report ID: DP-LIVE0001
Confidence: 73% (Threshold 85%)
Readiness: FOLLOW_UP_REQUIRED

## Summary
Cylinder 1 misfire observed on 2016 Toyota Camry. Reported symptoms: Rough idle, stalls at stops, CEL on intermittently.. Codes observed: P0301, P0171.

## Safety Flags
- None

## Findings
- [74%] Cylinder 1 misfire observed — OBD-II code P0301 indicates repeated misfires on cylinder 1. Combine symptom report of rough idle and stalls to inspect ignition and fueling on that cylinder.
- [72%] Bank 1 running lean — P0171 indicates the ECM is adding fuel beyond normal trims to maintain mixture, pointing to vacuum leaks, fuel delivery restriction, or unmetered air at idle.

## Recommendations
### Inspect ignition components for cylinder 1 (PROFESSIONAL)
- Swap cylinder 1 coil and plug with a known-good cylinder
- Check plug gap and signs of fouling or fuel wash
- Validate injector pulse and cylinder contribution with scan tool

### Check for vacuum leaks and fuel delivery issues (PROFESSIONAL)
- Smoke-test intake system for leaks downstream of the MAF
- Inspect PCV system and intake ducting for loose clamps
- Measure fuel pressure and regulator response at idle

## Confidence Uplift
- Capture misfire counters and fuel trims during idle and loaded conditions.
- Provide compression or leakdown measurements for cylinder 1.
- Provide long-term and short-term fuel trims at idle and 2500 RPM.
- Share recent MAF sensor cleaning or replacement history.
