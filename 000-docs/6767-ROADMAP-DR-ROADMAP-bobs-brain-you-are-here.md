# Bob's Brain – You Are Here

**Doc Type:** Roadmap / Orientation
**Scope:** `bobs-brain` repo (Bob + ADK/IAM department)
**Audience:** Future Jeremy, collaborators, and new engineers

---

## 1. Purpose of This Repo

This repo is the **reference implementation** of how Intent Solutions builds:

- A primary orchestrator agent (**Bob**)
- A specialist ADK/Vertex team (**IAM department**)
- A clean set of standards (6767 docs, ARV, Hard Mode rules)
- A deployment path to **Vertex AI Agent Engine** with Cloud Run gateways

Later, this structure will become the first "single-team starter template" for:

- `intent-agent-model-jvp-base`
- And any future "department repos" (DiagnosticPro, PipelinePilot, etc.)

---

## 2. Current Architecture (High Level)

**Agents:**

- `bob` – global orchestrator (user-facing)
- `iam-senior-adk-devops-lead` – foreman for ADK/Vertex work
- `iam-*` specialists:
  - `iam-adk` (ADK compliance / patterns)
  - `iam-issue` (GitHub issue specs + creation)
  - `iam-fix-plan` (solution design)
  - `iam-fix-impl` (implementation)
  - `iam-qa` (testing / validation)
  - `iam-doc` (docs & runbooks)
  - `iam-cleanup` (tech debt & refactors)
  - `iam-index` (knowledge indexing & org storage)

**Key supporting pieces:**

- `agents/config/*` – feature flags, org storage, Agent Engine IDs, etc.
- `service/*` – Cloud Run services (Slack webhook, a2a gateway)
- `infra/terraform` – infra definition (to be expanded to manage Agent Engine)
- `scripts/*` – checks, portfolio audits, smoke tests
- `000-docs/` – all documentation
  - 6767-prefixed = **canonical cross-repo standards**
  - Normal numeric = repo-local guides, AARs, SITREPs

---

## 3. What's Done vs In Flight

### Done (High Confidence)

- Repo structure cleaned (agents/service/scripts/archive/000-docs)
- IAM department implemented (Bob + foreman + specialists)
- 6767 doc convention implemented and corrected
- Org-wide GCS storage pattern (LIVE1) designed and implemented
- Portfolio audit flows (multi-repo SWE audits) implemented
- Slack notifications plumbing (LIVE3A) implemented but **flagged OFF by default**
- ARV / Hard Mode design for:
  - ADK-only agents
  - Single docs root
  - No local runner in Cloud Run gateways
  - Config/feature flag safety
- **AE-DEV-WIREUP (✅ COMPLETE)**
  Wired Bob + IAM into Vertex AI Agent Engine via a2a gateway:
  - Centralized Agent Engine config module
  - a2a HTTP gateway (Cloud Run) with clean JSON contract
  - Dev-only smoke tests + comprehensive documentation

### In Flight / Planned

- **Slack "re-attach"**
  - Ensure Slack app points at the new Cloud Run webhook/gateway
  - End-to-end tests: Slack → gateway → Agent Engine → Bob → Slack

- **LIVE3B/C** – GitHub issue creation + full integration docs
  - iam-issue wired to create real GitHub issues (with DRY-RUN safety)
  - Live3 docs, operator runbook, and config sanity checks

- **Template Extraction**
  - Lift this IAM department into `intent-agent-model-jvp-base` as the canonical "one department / one team" starter kit

---

## 4. Where This Is Going

Near-term goals:

1. **Bob reachable in dev via Slack (and optionally Discord/Web UI)**
2. **IAM department able to audit other repos** using:
   - Repo cloning/inspection
   - Org GCS data
   - Vertex AI Search (RAG)
3. **One-click-ish pattern** to:
   - Spin up a new "department repo"
   - Port in the IAM team
   - Wire it to Agent Engine and org storage

Long-term:

- `bobs-brain` and `intent-agent-model-jvp-base` become the **standard pattern** for:
  - Vertex AI ADK agent teams
  - Multi-agent departments you can replicate across your entire portfolio

---

## 5. How to Read the 6767 Docs

- `6767-xxx-DR-STND-*`
  Cross-repo standards (naming, ARV rules, department design, etc.)

- `6767-xxx-DR-GUIDE-*`
  Cross-repo how-to guides (porting departments, using Bob + IAM, etc.)

- `6767-xxx-AA-REPT-*` / `6767-xxx-PM-*`
  Canonical AARs and postmortems that define how **all** future repos should behave.

If future you is ever lost, read:

1. This roadmap
2. The top-level `README.md`
3. `6767-104-DR-STND-iam-department-template-scope-and-rules.md` (or equivalent)
4. The latest SITREP doc

---

## 6. Front Doors to Bob: Platform Strategy

### Primary: Slack (Work Context)

**Slack Free vs Pro:**
- **Free plan:** $0, 90-day message history, limited integrations
- **Pro plan:** ~$7.25-8.75/user/month, unlimited history, full integrations

**Recommendation:** Start on Slack Free
- Bob's memory lives in Vertex/GCS/logs, not Slack history
- 90-day limit is human convenience, not a blocker
- Upgrade to Pro only if you need:
  - Long-term searchable human chat history
  - More collaborators using Slack broadly
  - Heavy workflow/integration usage

**Pros:**
- Strong work context (threads, channels, permissions)
- Clean app model + good security
- Easy to lock down (less spam)
- Natural home for dev/ops assistant

**Cons:**
- Paid tiers add up per user
- Free plan history limit
- Heavier than simple chat options

### Secondary: Discord (Community/Lab Front Door)

**Cost:** Free with unlimited message history

**Pros:**
- Great for public/semi-public community
- Free with multiple channels
- Users already expect bots
- Good gateway & REST APIs

**Cons:**
- More "noisy" without moderation
- Less "work mode," more "community mode"
- Another thing to maintain

### Tertiary: Web Dashboard (Control Panel)

**What it is:** Small web UI talking to a2a gateway

**Shows:**
- Conversation with Bob
- Agent runs / audit status
- Links to relevant docs

**Pros:**
- Fully under your control
- Easy to add admin tools
- Good demo surface

**Cons:**
- Must build and maintain
- Doesn't replace chat for quick Q&A

### Skip for Now

**WhatsApp:**
- 2025 policy updates restrict general-purpose AI chatbots
- Per-message billing complexity
- Not worth the headache

**Telegram:**
- Good for "phone only" experience
- Skip unless you want broader public access
- Not as integrated with dev workflow
