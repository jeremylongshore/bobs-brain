# Phase 21 Terminal Verification and Drift Fix - AAR

**Document ID:** 155-AA-REPT-phase-21-terminal-verification-and-drift-fix
**Type:** After-Action Report (AAR)
**Phase:** Phase 21 (Terminal Verification)
**Status:** Complete
**Date:** 2025-11-23
**Session Type:** Linux Terminal (Local Development Environment)
**Branch:** `claude/phase-21-gcp-setup-01LJYGDWWVQ7hrk8GZFx9Yh3` → `feature/a2a-agentcards-foreman-worker`

---

## Executive Summary

This session verified Phase 21 work from the web Claude Code environment in the Linux terminal, fixed a critical drift check blocker, reconciled Phase 21 changes with the main working branch, and prepared the repository for Phase 22.

### Key Achievements

✅ **Verified Phase 21 deliverables** from web session in local terminal environment
✅ **Fixed drift check blocker** preventing PR #14 from merging (archive/ and claudes-docs/ exclusions)
✅ **Reconciled branches** - Phase 21 and working branch both healthy
✅ **Pushed fixes** to Phase 21 branch and updated PR #14
✅ **Restored clean state** on `feature/a2a-agentcards-foreman-worker` working branch
✅ **Proposed Phase 22** scope and structure for next work

### Critical Fix

**Drift Check Blocker:** R1 violations in `archive/` and `claudes-docs/` directories containing legacy code and documentation with LangChain/CrewAI references. Fixed by excluding these directories from drift detection script.

**Impact:** PR #14 was blocked from merging due to CI failure. Fix allows Phase 21 to merge cleanly.

---

## Context

### Starting State

**Web Session Continuation:**
- Phase 21 work completed in web Claude Code environment
- Changes pushed to branch `claude/phase-21-gcp-setup-01LJYGDWWVQ7hrk8GZFx9Yh3`
- PR #14 created: "Set up Claude Code for Phase 21 GCP"
- PR blocked by CI drift check failure
- Operator checklist (154-NOTE) created in web session but uncommitted

**Mission:**
1. Verify Phase 21 work in local Linux terminal
2. Fix any blockers preventing PR merge
3. Reconcile with main working branch
4. Restore clean development state
5. Propose next phase

## Part 1: Repo Sanity Check

### Repo Location & Status

**Path:** `/home/jeremy/000-projects/iams/bobs-brain`

**Remote:**
```
origin  https://github.com/jeremylongshore/bobs-brain.git
```

**Initial State:**
- Current branch: `claude/phase-21-gcp-setup-01LJYGDWWVQ7hrk8GZFx9Yh3` (Phase 21)
- Untracked file: `000-docs/154-NOTE-bobs-brain-first-real-deploy-operator-checklist.md`
- Working tree: Clean (except untracked file)

### Branch Summary

| Branch | Tracks | Last Commit | Message |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------|
| `claude/phase-21-gcp-setup-01LJYGDWWVQ7hrk8GZFx9Yh3` ⭐ | `origin/claude/...` | `e98fd1d4` | docs: add Project Creation Sanity Check to Phase 21 AAR |
| `feature/a2a-agentcards-foreman-worker` | (no remote) | `4285a7ef` | docs: add appauditmini quick reference card |
| `main` | `origin/main` (ahead 30) | `45ff6873` | docs: add prompt design standard for bob |

**Analysis:**
- Phase 21 branch exists and is up-to-date with remote
- Working branch (`feature/a2a-agentcards-foreman-worker`) is Phase 20 work
- Main branch is ahead of origin by 30 commits (likely local dev work)

## Part 2: PR & Phase 21 Reconciliation

### PR #14 Status (Initial)

**PR Details:**
- **Title:** Set up Claude Code for Phase 21 GCP
- **Head:** `claude/phase-21-gcp-setup-01LJYGDWWVQ7hrk8GZFx9Yh3`
- **Base:** `main`
- **State:** OPEN
- **CI Status:** ❌ **FAILURE**

**CI Failure Analysis:**
```json
{
  "drift-check": "FAILURE",
  "arv-check": "SKIPPED",
  "terraform-validate": "SKIPPED",
  "documentation-check": "SKIPPED",
  "structure-validation": "SKIPPED",
  "lint": "SKIPPED",
  "test": "SKIPPED",
  "security": "SKIPPED",
  "ci-success": "SKIPPED"
}
```

**Root Cause:** Drift check failed, blocking all other CI jobs.

### Phase 21 Deliverables Verification

**Expected files (from Phase 21 AARs):**
- ✅ `000-docs/152-AA-REPT-phase-21-agent-engine-dev-first-live-deploy-and-smoke-tests.md` (21 KB)
- ✅ `000-docs/153-NOTE-bobs-brain-first-real-agent-engine-deploy-playbook.md` (15 KB)
- ✅ `000-docs/154-NOTE-bobs-brain-first-real-deploy-operator-checklist.md` (23 KB, untracked)
- ✅ `scripts/deploy_inline_source.py` (8.4 KB)
- ✅ `scripts/smoke_test_agent_engine.py` (9.1 KB)
- ✅ `.github/workflows/deploy-containerized-dev.yml` (9.7 KB)

**Verification:** All Phase 21 files present and correct.

### Drift Check Investigation

**Running drift check locally:**
```bash
bash scripts/ci/check_nodrift.sh
```

**Output:**
```
R1: Checking for alternative agent frameworks...
./archive/2025-11-11-final-cleanup/.../agents/crewai_coding_crew/app/agent.py:from langchain_google_vertexai...
./archive/.../agents/langgraph_base_react/app/agent.py:from langchain_google_vertexai...
[... 40+ violations in archive/ directory ...]

❌ VIOLATION R1: Alternative framework imports found
   Only google-adk is allowed for agent implementation
```

**Root Cause Identified:**
1. **Archive directory (`archive/`)** contains old Agent Starter Pack templates
2. These templates use LangChain, CrewAI, LangGraph (pre-Hard Mode code)
3. Drift check script scans entire repo including archived legacy code
4. Script already excluded `99-Archive` but not `archive/`

**Analysis:**
- Archive directory is intentionally archived legacy code
- Not part of active codebase
- Should be excluded from R1 compliance checks
- This is a drift check configuration issue, not a code violation

### Fix Applied (Phase 21 Branch)

**File:** `scripts/ci/check_nodrift.sh`

**Changes:**
```diff
-EXCLUDE_DIRS=".venv|99-Archive|node_modules"
+EXCLUDE_DIRS=".venv|99-Archive|archive|node_modules"

 if grep -rE "from langchain|import langchain|from crewai|import crewai|from autogen|import autogen" \
     --exclude-dir=.venv \
     --exclude-dir=99-Archive \
+    --exclude-dir=archive \
     --exclude-dir=node_modules \
     --exclude-dir=000-docs \
     . 2>/dev/null | grep -v "CLAUDE.md" | grep -v "check_nodrift.sh"; then
```

**Verification:**
```bash
bash scripts/ci/check_nodrift.sh
# Output: ✅ No drift violations detected
```

**Commit:**
```
fix(ci): exclude archive/ directory from drift detection

Archive directory contains old Agent Starter Pack templates with
LangChain/CrewAI/LangGraph code that pre-dates Hard Mode compliance.

Changes:
- Added archive/ to EXCLUDE_DIRS list
- Added --exclude-dir=archive to R1 grep command

Fixes drift check blocking PR #14.
```

## Part 3: Working Branch Reconciliation

### Switch to Working Branch

**Branch:** `feature/a2a-agentcards-foreman-worker` (Phase 20 work)

```bash
git checkout feature/a2a-agentcards-foreman-worker
git fetch origin
git status
# Output: Clean working tree
```

### Health Checks on Working Branch

**Drift check:**
```bash
bash scripts/ci/check_nodrift.sh
```

**Output:**
```
R1: Checking for alternative agent frameworks...
./claudes-docs/DEVOPS-ONBOARDING-ANALYSIS.md:   Command: grep -r "from langchain\|from crewai" agents/
❌ VIOLATION R1: Alternative framework imports found
```

**New Issue Discovered:**
- `claudes-docs/` directory contains documentation with example grep commands
- These commands include text like `from langchain` (as documentation, not code)
- Triggers false positive in drift check

**Additional directory to exclude:**
- `claudes-docs/` - Claude-generated analysis docs (not active code)

**A2A readiness:**
```bash
python scripts/check_a2a_readiness.py
```

**Output:**
```
✅ ALL A2A READINESS CHECKS PASSED ✅
Ready for Agent Engine deployment (when infrastructure is available)
```

### Fix Applied (Working Branch)

**File:** `scripts/ci/check_nodrift.sh`

**Changes (complete fix):**
```diff
-EXCLUDE_DIRS=".venv|99-Archive|node_modules"
+EXCLUDE_DIRS=".venv|99-Archive|archive|node_modules|claudes-docs"

 if grep -rE "from langchain|import langchain|from crewai|import crewai|from autogen|import autogen" \
     --exclude-dir=.venv \
     --exclude-dir=99-Archive \
+    --exclude-dir=archive \
     --exclude-dir=node_modules \
     --exclude-dir=000-docs \
+    --exclude-dir=claudes-docs \
     . 2>/dev/null | grep -v "CLAUDE.md" | grep -v "check_nodrift.sh"; then
```

**Verification:**
```bash
bash scripts/ci/check_nodrift.sh
# Output: ✅ No drift violations detected
```

**Commit:**
```
fix(ci): exclude archive/ and claudes-docs/ from drift detection

Archive directory contains old Agent Starter Pack templates with
LangChain/CrewAI/LangGraph code that pre-dates Hard Mode compliance.

claudes-docs/ contains documentation analysis with example grep
commands that trigger false positives.

Both directories are not active code and should be excluded from R1 checks.

Changes:
- Added archive/ and claudes-docs/ to EXCLUDE_DIRS list
- Added --exclude-dir flags to R1 grep command

Fixes drift check blocking CI on this branch and Phase 21 PR.
```

**Commit hash:** `9b4bb627`

### Final Health Check (Working Branch)

**Drift detection:** ✅ PASS
**A2A readiness:** ✅ PASS (all 8 agents validated)
**pytest:** ⚠️ Collection errors (expected - google.adk not installed locally)

**pytest summary:**
```
collected 309 items / 37 errors
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Interrupted: 37 errors during collection !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
```

**Analysis:**
- Collection errors from `archive/` templates and missing `google.adk`
- Expected in local environment (CI has proper dependencies)
- Not a blocker for development

## Part 4: Next Phase Proposal

### Phase 22 Scope

**Proposed:** Phase 22 - Foreman Deployment + Production Monitoring

**Rationale:**
1. Phase 21 deployed bob to Agent Engine (dry-run mode working)
2. Foreman (`iam-senior-adk-devops-lead`) is next component in architecture
3. bob → foreman A2A wiring needs verification
4. Production monitoring essential before real usage
5. Completes initial Agent Engine deployment story

**Primary Goals:**
1. Deploy `iam-senior-adk-devops-lead` (foreman) to Agent Engine dev
2. Verify A2A protocol between bob → foreman
3. Set up Cloud Monitoring dashboards
4. Configure alerting policies
5. Extend smoke tests to cover foreman
6. Document foreman deployment patterns

**Why Now:**
- Infrastructure ready (Phase 21 deployment script and workflow)
- Foreman agent exists and has AgentCard
- Next logical step in multi-agent architecture
- Monitoring needed before production usage

### Proposed Branch & Documentation

**Branch name:**
```bash
phase-22-foreman-deploy-and-monitoring
```

**AAR filename:**
```
000-docs/156-AA-REPT-phase-22-foreman-deploy-and-production-monitoring.md
```

**Note:** Using `156` instead of `155` because this AAR is `155`.

**Commands to execute (when approved):**
```bash
# Start from clean working branch
git checkout feature/a2a-agentcards-foreman-worker
git pull --rebase origin feature/a2a-agentcards-foreman-worker  # if needed

# Create Phase 22 branch
git checkout -b phase-22-foreman-deploy-and-monitoring

# Create AAR skeleton
touch 000-docs/156-AA-REPT-phase-22-foreman-deploy-and-production-monitoring.md

# (Open editor to populate AAR with initial structure)
```

**Status:** Awaiting approval before execution.

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Systematic verification process** - Step-by-step verification caught all issues
2. **Root cause analysis** - Quickly identified drift check configuration issue
3. **Minimal fixes** - Changes were surgical (only exclusion lists, no code changes)
4. **Branch reconciliation** - Both Phase 21 and working branch now healthy
5. **Documentation** - All changes documented with clear commit messages

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Drift check coverage in web session** - Should have run drift check before pushing
2. **Archive exclusion earlier** - Could have excluded archive/ when it was created
3. **PR creation timing** - Should verify CI passes before creating PR

### Action Items for Future Phases

- [ ] **Pre-push checklist:**
  - [ ] Run drift check locally
  - [ ] Run ARV checks
  - [ ] Run A2A readiness (if available)
  - [ ] Verify all tests pass (or expected failures documented)

- [ ] **CI monitoring:**
  - [ ] Check CI status immediately after PR creation
  - [ ] Fix failures before moving to next task

- [ ] **Archive management:**
  - [ ] Document what belongs in archive/ vs 99-Archive/ vs claudes-docs/
  - [ ] Update drift check exclusions when adding new archive directories
