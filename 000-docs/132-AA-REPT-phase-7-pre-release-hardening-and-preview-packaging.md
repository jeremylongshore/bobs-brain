---

## V. Quality Validation

**Pre-Commit Checks (All Passed):**
- [x] Drift detection: No violations (bash scripts/ci/check_nodrift.sh)
- [x] ARV checks: Passing (make check-inline-deploy-ready)
- [x] Dry-run validation: Passing (make deploy-inline-dry-run)
- [x] Tests: 18 AgentCard + 36 storage tests passing (100% success rate)

**Documentation Quality:**
- [x] All 6767 docs follow NNN-CC-ABCD naming convention
- [x] External citations provided for all upstream resources
- [x] Internal cross-references use relative paths
- [x] No broken links (verified manually)

**Commit Quality:**
- [x] Conventional commit format (chore, docs prefix)
- [x] Clear, descriptive commit bodies
- [x] Reference to relevant docs and standards
- [x] Logical grouping (version sync, 6767 docs, README, CLAUDE.md, release)

---

## VI. Lessons Learned

**What Went Well:**
- Version synchronization was straightforward (CHANGELOG, README, .env.example)
- 6767-120 master index provides clear entry point for new users
- External citations improve transparency and traceability
- "Start Here" section addresses 3 distinct audiences effectively
- TL;DR in CLAUDE.md reduces cognitive load for operators

**What Could Be Improved:**
- Some specialist agents (iam-issue, iam-fix-plan, iam-fix-impl, iam-qa) still have skeleton structure
- a2a-inspector CI integration deferred to future phase
- Production deployment runbook not yet created

**Process Observations:**
- Repo-only work (no GCP) allowed rapid iteration without deployment blockers
- Small, focused commits made review and rollback straightforward
- Documentation-first approach clarified scope before implementation

---

## VII. Recommendations for Next Phase

**Option 1: Merge to Main & Create GitHub Release (Recommended)**

**Steps:**
1. Merge feature/a2a-agentcards-foreman-worker to main
2. Verify CI passes on main branch
3. Create tag: v0.10.0-preview
4. Publish GitHub Release using template from 131-AA-REPT
5. Monitor for external user feedback

**Rationale:**
- Repository is "showable" to external developers
- All documentation is complete and accurate
- No blockers for sharing with interested parties
- Real deployment can happen independently of release

**Option 2: Phase 8 - GCP Deployment Pairing**

**Steps:**
1. Execute Phase 6 dev deployment when GCP access is available
2. Capture agent resource name from deployment logs
3. Run smoke test and validate deployed agent
4. Update AAR (130-AA-REPT) with actual deployment results
5. Merge after successful deployment validation

**Rationale:**
- Validates end-to-end infrastructure before public release
- Provides real deployment data for documentation
- Reduces risk of documentation inaccuracies

**Option 3: Phase 8 - a2a-inspector CI Integration & Golden Tests**

**Steps:**
1. Integrate a2a-inspector into GitHub Actions workflow
2. Create golden tests for AgentCard validation
3. Add ARV checks for all specialist agents (not just bob)
4. Validate foreman to worker A2A delegation patterns
5. Document runtime validation in 6767 standards

**Rationale:**
- Strengthens A2A contract validation
- Catches AgentCard regressions automatically
- Aligns with contract-first philosophy

---

## VIII. Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: External Users Expect Deployed Agents**

**Severity:** Medium
**Likelihood:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Release title clearly states "Preview (Dev-Ready, Not Deployed)"
- README.md Project Status explicitly states infrastructure ready, not deployed
- Release checklist Section III documents what is NOT yet done
- GitHub Release description has dedicated "What's NOT Included" section

**Status:** Mitigated through clear documentation

**Risk 2: Documentation Gaps Prevent Template Adoption**

**Severity:** Low
**Likelihood:** Low

**Mitigation:**
- Porting guide provides step-by-step instructions
- Integration checklist ensures nothing is missed
- Template standards clarify what to customize
- 6767-120 master index provides complete reference map

**Status:** Mitigated through comprehensive documentation

**Risk 3: Version Drift Post-Release**

**Severity:** Low
**Likelihood:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Version numbers synchronized across all files (CHANGELOG, README, .env.example)
- Future updates must update all version references
- Consider adding version validation script to CI

**Status:** Partially mitigated; recommend CI check for version consistency

---

**Documentation Coverage:**
- 6767 Standards: 10+ documents covering Agent Engine, A2A, deployment, operations
- AARs: 5+ implementation reports (including this one)
