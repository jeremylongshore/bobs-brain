## TROUBLESHOOTING REFERENCE

### If ARV Checks Fail
1. Check agent directory structure (agent.py present?)
2. Verify system prompts exist
3. Check shared_contracts imports
4. Review error messages in detail
5. Compare to bobs-brain reference implementation

### If Tests Fail
1. Verify PYTHONPATH is set correctly
2. Check synthetic repo exists
3. Review repos.yaml configuration
4. Check agent system prompts
5. Run with `-vvs` for detailed output

### If Pipeline Produces No Results
1. Verify repos.yaml is configured
2. Check repo_hint matches configured repo
3. Verify agents are responding (check logs)
4. Try with `--mode preview` first
5. Check tool implementations

### If CI Fails
1. Review CI logs for specific errors
2. Verify dependencies installed correctly
3. Check Python version matches local
4. Verify ARV checks run before tests
5. Check secrets/env vars configured
