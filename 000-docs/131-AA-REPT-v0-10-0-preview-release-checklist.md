# v0.10.0-preview Release Checklist

**Document Type:** After-Action Report / Release Checklist (AA-REPT)
**Document ID:** 131
**Status:** PLANNING
**Version:** v0.10.0-preview
**Release Type:** Preview Dev Release
**Purpose:** Prepare repository for sharing with external developers and operators
**Date:** 2025-11-21

---

## I. Purpose and Scope

This is a **preview dev release** for people who want to see the progress on Bob's Brain's Agent Engine / A2A infrastructure without requiring actual GCP deployment access.

**What This Release Provides:**
- Complete Agent Engine inline deployment infrastructure (ARV gates, CI workflows, smoke tests)
- A2A / AgentCard contracts for foreman + worker architecture
- Comprehensive 6767 documentation suite
- Fully testable codebase (no GCP credentials required for local development)

**What This Release Is NOT:**
- A production deployment (no agents running on Agent Engine yet)
- A complete end-to-end demonstration (Slack integration requires GCP deployment)
- A finalized A2A network integration (a2a-inspector runtime validation planned)

---

## II. What Works Today (v0.10.0-preview)

### ✅ Repository Structure & Documentation

**6767 Documentation Suite:**
- ✅ Master index (6767-120) with complete reference map
- ✅ ADK/Agent Engine specification (Hard Mode rules R1-R8)
- ✅ Inline source deployment standard
- ✅ AgentCard & A2A contracts standard
- ✅ Prompt design & contract-first philosophy
- ✅ ARV (Agent Readiness Verification) baseline
- ✅ Operations runbook for daily workflows

**Repository Organization:**
- ✅ Clean `000-docs/` folder with NNN-CC-ABCD filing system
- ✅ All agent code in `agents/` directory
- ✅ CI/CD workflows in `.github/workflows/`
- ✅ Comprehensive Makefile with quality checks
- ✅ Proper `.env.example` with all configuration documented

### ✅ IAM Department Agents (Multi-Agent Architecture)

**Foreman:**
- ✅ `iam-senior-adk-devops-lead` - Departmental foreman orchestrator
- ✅ AgentCard with PipelineRequest → PipelineResult contracts
- ✅ System prompt following 6767-115 template (123 lines, ~1,640 tokens)

**Specialists:**
- ✅ `iam-adk` - ADK/Vertex design and static analysis specialist
- ✅ `iam-issue` - GitHub issue creation specialist (planned)
- ✅ `iam-fix-plan` - Fix planning specialist (planned)
- ✅ `iam-fix-impl` - Fix implementation specialist (planned)
- ✅ `iam-qa` - Quality assurance specialist (planned)

**Note:** Specialist agents have skeleton structure; full implementation in progress.

### ✅ Tests & Quality Checks

**Test Suite:**
- ✅ 18 AgentCard validation tests (JSON syntax, A2A fields, SPIFFE ID, contracts)
- ✅ 36 org storage tests (config, GCS writer, feature flags)
- ✅ Portfolio orchestrator tests
- ✅ All tests passing (100% success rate)

**Quality Gates:**
- ✅ Drift detection (`bash scripts/ci/check_nodrift.sh`)
- ✅ ARV checks (`make check-inline-deploy-ready`)
- ✅ Dry-run validation (`make deploy-inline-dry-run`)
- ✅ Linting, type checking, security scanning (in CI)

### ✅ Agent Engine Deployment Infrastructure

**Inline Source Deployment (Production Pattern):**
- ✅ Deployment script (`agents/agent_engine/deploy_inline_source.py`)
- ✅ ARV validation script (`scripts/check_inline_deploy_ready.py`)
- ✅ Smoke test script (`scripts/smoke_test_bob_agent_engine_dev.py`)
- ✅ CI workflow (`.github/workflows/agent-engine-inline-dev-deploy.yml`)
- ✅ Makefile targets (`check-inline-deploy-ready`, `deploy-inline-dry-run`, `smoke-bob-agent-engine-dev`)

**Configuration:**
- ✅ Environment variable documentation (`.env.example`)
- ✅ Phase-by-phase implementation guide (5 phases in 6767-INLINE standard)
- ✅ Execution checklists and runbooks (in AARs)

### ✅ A2A / AgentCard Contracts

**AgentCard Implementation:**
- ✅ JSON-based AgentCards in `.well-known/agent-card.json` for all agents
- ✅ Skill definitions with strict input/output schemas
- ✅ Contract references ($comment fields) linking to Python dataclasses
- ✅ SPIFFE ID format compliance
- ✅ A2A protocol field alignment (authentication, framework, authorization)

**Validation:**
- ✅ Unit tests for AgentCard structure (`tests/unit/test_agentcard_json.py`)
- ✅ Cross-agent consistency checks
- ⏸️ Runtime validation via a2a-inspector (planned, not yet integrated)

### ✅ Org-Wide Features (v0.9.0 Legacy)

**Portfolio Orchestration:**
- ✅ Multi-repo SWE audit orchestrator
- ✅ Aggregated metrics and reporting
- ✅ JSON/Markdown export capabilities

**Org Storage:**
- ✅ GCS-based knowledge hub
- ✅ Portfolio summaries and per-repo results
- ✅ Feature-gated (disabled by default)

---

## III. What is NOT Yet Done (Blockers for Production)

### ⏸️ Agent Engine Deployment (Requires GCP Access)

**Status:** Infrastructure ready, not yet executed

**Blockers:**
- ❌ First dev deployment to Agent Engine (requires manual workflow trigger)
- ❌ Agent resource name capture (`BOB_AGENT_ENGINE_NAME_DEV` not set)
- ❌ Smoke test validation (requires deployed agent)
- ❌ Production deployment approval process

**Next Steps:**
- Execute Phase 6 dev deployment when GCP access is available
- Capture agent resource name from deployment logs
- Run smoke test to validate deployed agent
- Update AAR (130-AA-REPT) with actual deployment results

### ⏸️ Slack End-to-End Integration

**Status:** Gateway code exists, Slack → Agent Engine routing not live

**Blockers:**
- ❌ No deployed agents on Agent Engine (prerequisite)
- ❌ Slack bot OAuth tokens not configured in GCP Secret Manager
- ❌ A2A gateway not deployed to Cloud Run
- ❌ Slack workspace integration not tested end-to-end

**Next Steps:**
- Deploy agents to Agent Engine first
- Configure Slack secrets in GCP
- Deploy A2A gateway to Cloud Run
- Test Slack → Gateway → Agent Engine flow

### ⏸️ Full A2A / AgentCard Production Rollout

**Status:** Designed and validated, runtime integration pending

**Blockers:**
- ❌ a2a-inspector CI integration (planned but not implemented)
- ❌ External A2A network discovery (future enhancement)
- ❌ AgentCard publishing to public registry (future enhancement)
- ❌ Multi-agent runtime orchestration validation

**Next Steps:**
- Integrate a2a-inspector into CI workflow
- Create golden tests for AgentCard compliance
- Validate foreman → worker delegation in deployed environment
- Document A2A network integration patterns
