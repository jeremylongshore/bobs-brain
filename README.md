> 🚀 **Bob isn't just an AI assistant. Bob is your unfair advantage.**

## 💥 The Problem We're Solving

Every business is drowning in AI hype but starving for actual solutions. While your competitors are still figuring out ChatGPT prompts, Bob is already:
- 🎯 **Crushing support tickets** before humans even wake up
- 💰 **Saving customers thousands** with accurate diagnostics

- 🦾 **Scaling infinitely** without hiring a single person

**TL;DR:** Bob makes you look like a genius while you sleep.

### Knowledge Base Setup

```python
# Bob's brain uses ChromaDB for zero-hallucination responses
from bob.core.knowledge import KnowledgeBase

kb.add_knowledge("Your domain expertise here")
# Bob now knows your business better than you do
```
