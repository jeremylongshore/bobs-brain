# Product Requirements Document: Idea Tracking Agent
**Date**: 2025-09-12  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Draft

---

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The Idea Tracking Agent is an intelligent system that automatically evaluates, tracks, and filters business/project ideas based on market saturation, failure rates, and competitive analysis. The agent prevents wasted effort on saturated markets or previously failed concepts by maintaining a comprehensive knowledge base of ideas and their outcomes.

**Problem Statement**: Entrepreneurs and developers often pursue ideas that have already failed multiple times or exist in oversaturated markets, wasting valuable time and resources on ventures with low probability of success.

**Goal**: Create an AI agent that acts as an intelligent idea filter, automatically identifying and flagging bad ideas while preserving and organizing promising concepts for further development.

## 2. Goals

### Primary Goals
- **Idea Deduplication**: Automatically detect when a new idea is substantially similar to existing failed or saturated concepts
- **Market Saturation Analysis**: Evaluate market density and competition levels for proposed ideas
- **Failure Pattern Recognition**: Identify common patterns in failed ideas to predict likelihood of success
- **Idea Portfolio Management**: Organize and prioritize ideas based on viability scores

### Secondary Goals  
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify emerging opportunities and declining markets
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Track competitor activities and market positioning
- **Success Prediction**: Score ideas based on multiple success factors

## 3. User Stories

**As a serial entrepreneur, I want to** submit new business ideas and receive immediate feedback on their viability **so that I can** avoid pursuing oversaturated or historically unsuccessful concepts.

**As a product manager, I want to** track the lifecycle of ideas from conception to market analysis **so that I can** make data-driven decisions about resource allocation.

**As a startup advisor, I want to** access a database of idea outcomes and market analysis **so that I can** provide informed guidance to entrepreneurs.

**As a developer, I want to** check if my project idea has been attempted before **so that I can** learn from previous failures or pivot to unexplored variations.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Idea Ingestion**: Accept ideas via text input, voice notes, or document upload
2. **Similarity Detection**: Use semantic analysis to identify similar existing ideas
3. **Market Research**: Automatically gather market data, competitor analysis, and trend information
4. **Failure Analysis**: Research and analyze reasons for failure in similar past ventures
5. **Saturation Scoring**: Calculate market saturation scores based on competitor density
6. **Viability Rating**: Generate comprehensive viability scores (0-100) for each idea
7. **Automated Filtering**: Flag ideas below configurable viability thresholds
8. **Idea Archiving**: Automatically archive or suggest disposal of low-viability ideas

### Data Management
9. **Idea Database**: Maintain persistent storage of all analyzed ideas
10. **Outcome Tracking**: Track real-world outcomes of previously analyzed ideas
11. **Pattern Learning**: Continuously improve predictions based on actual results
12. **Export/Import**: Support data export for backup and import from external sources

### User Interface
13. **Dashboard**: Display idea portfolio with viability scores and status
14. **Detailed Reports**: Generate comprehensive analysis reports for each idea
15. **Trend Visualization**: Show market trends and competitive landscape graphs
16. **Alert System**: Notify users of significant market changes affecting their ideas

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Idea Generation**: The agent analyzes existing ideas but does not create new ones
- **Business Plan Creation**: Detailed business planning is outside the scope
- **Market Execution**: No actual market testing or product development
- **Financial Modeling**: Detailed financial projections and funding analysis
- **Legal Analysis**: Patent research or legal compliance checking
- **Team Building**: Recruitment or team assembly functionality

## 6. Design Considerations

### User Interface
- **Clean Dashboard**: Simple, intuitive interface showing idea status at a glance
- **Traffic Light System**: Green (good), Yellow (caution), Red (avoid) visual indicators
- **Detailed Drill-Down**: Click through from summary to detailed analysis
- **Mobile Responsive**: Accessible on various devices for idea capture on-the-go

### Data Visualization
- **Market Maps**: Visual representation of competitive landscapes
- **Trend Charts**: Historical and projected market trend visualizations  
- **Success/Failure Patterns**: Visual patterns in idea characteristics

## 7. Technical Considerations

### Architecture Integration
- **Multi-Agent System**: Integrate as a specialized agent in the LangGraph orchestrator
- **FastAPI Service**: Expose functionality via REST API for modularity
- **Database Requirements**: Neo4j for relationship mapping, ChromaDB for semantic similarity

### Data Sources
- **Web Scraping**: Automated market research from various sources
- **API Integration**: Connect to business databases, patent offices, startup registries
- **User Submissions**: Manual idea input and outcome reporting
- **Public Datasets**: Failed startup databases, market research reports

### AI/ML Components
- **Semantic Analysis**: NLP for idea similarity detection
- **Market Prediction**: ML models for saturation and trend analysis
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify failure patterns in historical data
- **Scoring Algorithms**: Multi-factor viability scoring system

## 8. Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **False Positive Rate**: < 15% of flagged "bad" ideas actually succeed
- **True Positive Rate**: > 70% of unflagged ideas show market potential
- **Time Savings**: Users report 50%+ reduction in time spent on unviable ideas
- **Database Growth**: Continuous expansion of idea and outcome database

### Secondary Metrics  
- **User Engagement**: Daily active usage of idea evaluation features
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Improvement in success prediction over time
- **Market Coverage**: Breadth of industries and markets analyzed
- **User Satisfaction**: High ratings for idea filtering accuracy

## 9. Open Questions

### Technical Questions
- **Real-time vs Batch Processing**: Should market analysis run continuously or on-demand?
- **Data Privacy**: How to handle sensitive/proprietary idea information?
- **Scalability**: What volume of ideas and analysis requests should the system handle?

### Business Questions
- **Success Definition**: How do we define and measure idea "success" vs "failure"?
- **Market Scope**: Should focus be on specific industries or remain broad?
- **Update Frequency**: How often should market and competitive data be refreshed?

### Integration Questions  
- **External APIs**: Which market research APIs and data sources to prioritize?
- **User Workflow**: How does this integrate with existing idea management tools?
- **Agent Communication**: How should this agent coordinate with other agents in the system?
