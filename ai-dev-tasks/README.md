## 💡 How to Use (Enhanced)

### **🆕 Start with Strategic Analysis:**
   - Review `analysis/` documents for context
   - Understand current system state and opportunities
   - Identify integration priorities

### **1. Create a PRD:**
   - Tell Claude: "Create a PRD for [your feature]"
   - Claude uses `templates/create-prd.md`
   - Saves to `PRDs/`

### **2. Break it into tasks:**
   - Tell Claude: "Generate tasks from that PRD"
   - Claude uses `templates/generate-tasks.md`
   - Saves to `todos/`

### **3. Move to project & build:**
   - Copy PRD and tasks to target project
   - Tell Claude: "Start with task 1.1"
   - Claude builds the actual code in that project
   - Uses `process-task-list.md` to work through tasks

## 🎯 Priority Actions (Based on Analysis)

### **🤔 Exploration Option A - Multi-Agent Architecture**
```bash
# Create PRD to explore multi-agent refactor concept
cd ai-dev-tasks/
# Tell Claude: "Create an exploratory PRD for multi-agent architecture"
```

### **🔍 Exploration Option B - Graphiti Integration** 
```bash
# Create PRD to explore Graphiti integration possibilities
# Tell Claude: "Create an exploratory PRD for Graphiti integration concepts"
```

### **📊 Exploration Option C - Architecture Comparison**
```bash
# Explore different architecture approaches found in analysis
# Tell Claude: "Create comparison PRD for different Bob architecture options"
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# View current analysis
ls analysis/

# View templates
ls templates/

# Check your PRDs
ls PRDs/

# See task lists
ls todos/

# Start new feature development
# Tell Claude: "I want to build [feature]" and let the workflow guide you!
```
