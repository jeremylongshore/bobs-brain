# Bob AI Agent Consolidation Project

## Project Mission
Consolidate Jeremy's fragmented Bob AI implementations into ONE unified agent.

## Current Bob Chaos (DO NOT TOUCH YET)
- Active Slack bot: process 56701 running simple_bot.py (PRESERVE)
- Multiple Python files: query_bob_knowledge.py, bob_simple_chat.py, ask_bob.py, talk_to_bob.py
- Knowledge base: ~/.bob_brain/chroma/ (970+ items to migrate)
- Directories: .bob_brain/, bobs_brain/, bob_brain_backup/
- GitHub repos: Multiple Bob repositories causing confusion
- Home directory is a git repo (needs cleanup)

## CRITICAL RULES
- NEVER kill process 56701 (active Slack bot)
- NEVER delete original files until unified Bob is tested
- ALWAYS backup before any changes
- Slack integration is NON-NEGOTIABLE
- Professional business communication style (repair industry expert)
- GitHub cleanup required - eliminate Bob confusion
