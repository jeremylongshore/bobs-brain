# PRD-003: Bob v3 - Enterprise Production System

**Date**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Implemented
**Branch**: feature/graphiti-production

## Introduction/Overview

Bob v3 represents the full enterprise production deployment with 40+ data sources, Cloud Run services, BigQuery analytics, and the Circle of Life learning system. This version transforms Bob from a development prototype into a battle-tested production system capable of 24/7 operation at scale.

## Goals

1. Deploy complete production infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform
2. Integrate 40+ data sources for comprehensive knowledge aggregation
3. Implement Circle of Life continuous learning system
4. Establish BigQuery analytics and pattern recognition
5. Achieve < $30/month operational costs with 99.9% uptime

## User Stories

- As an **enterprise user**, I want 24/7 availability so that Bob is always accessible
- As a **data scientist**, I want BigQuery analytics so that I can analyze patterns across millions of records
- As a **technician**, I want technical bulletin scraping so that I have access to latest repair information
- As a **system administrator**, I want automated data collection so that knowledge stays current
- As a **CFO**, I want cost-efficient operation so that ROI is maximized

## Functional Requirements

Based on verified code in feature/graphiti-production branch:

1. **Cloud Run Services (3 Essential)**
   - 1.1 bobs-brain: Main AI assistant with Slack integration

   - 1.3 circle-of-life-scraper: MVP3 diagnostic integration
   - 1.4 VPC connector for secure Neo4j access
   - 1.5 Auto-scaling with 0 min instances for cost control

2. **Data Collection Pipeline**
   - 2.1 YouTube transcript extraction (equipment repair videos)
   - 2.2 Technical Service Bulletin (TSB) scraping
   - 2.3 Reddit community integration via PRAW
   - 2.4 Forum and discussion board monitoring
   - 2.5 RSS feed aggregation for industry news
   - 2.6 Scheduled scraping (hourly quick, daily comprehensive)

3. **Circle of Life Learning System**
   - 3.1 MVP3 diagnostic system bidirectional sync
   - 3.2 Continuous feedback loop for model improvement
   - 3.3 Pattern recognition using BigQuery ML
   - 3.4 REST API endpoints for diagnostic submission
   - 3.5 Automated ingestion schedules

4. **BigQuery Analytics**
   - 4.1 266 production tables for structured data
   - 4.2 Pattern recognition across repair histories
   - 4.3 Cost analysis and optimization metrics
   - 4.4 ML pipeline for predictive maintenance
   - 4.5 Real-time analytics dashboards

5. **Infrastructure & DevOps**
   - 5.1 Docker containerization for all services
   - 5.2 Cloud Build CI/CD pipelines
   - 5.3 Secret Manager for credential storage
   - 5.4 Cloud Monitoring and alerting
   - 5.5 Makefile automation for deployment

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Mobile application development
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Real-time video processing
- Voice interaction capabilities
- International language support

## Technical Considerations
