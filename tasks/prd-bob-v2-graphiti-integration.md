# PRD-002: Bob v2 - Graphiti Knowledge Graph Integration

**Date**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Implemented
**Branch**: enhance-bob-graphiti

## Introduction/Overview

Bob v2 evolves the simple template into an intelligent system with knowledge graph capabilities. This version integrates Graphiti Core for automatic entity extraction and Neo4j for relationship-based knowledge storage, creating a bot that learns from conversations and builds structured knowledge over time.

## Goals

1. Integrate Neo4j graph database for relationship-based knowledge
2. Implement Graphiti Core for automatic entity extraction
3. Migrate from ChromaDB vectors to unified graph architecture
4. Enable temporal knowledge tracking
5. Maintain backward compatibility with v1 features

## User Stories

- As a **developer**, I want my bot to automatically extract entities from conversations so that it builds knowledge without manual input
- As a **user**, I want the bot to remember relationships between concepts so that it provides more contextual responses
- As a **system administrator**, I want unified data architecture so that maintenance is simplified
- As a **data analyst**, I want structured knowledge graphs so that I can analyze conversation patterns

## Functional Requirements

Based on verified code in enhance-bob-graphiti branch:

1. **Neo4j Integration**
   - 1.1 Connect to Neo4j Aura cloud instance
   - 1.2 Create and manage 295 equipment nodes
   - 1.3 Establish relationship edges between entities
   - 1.4 Support Cypher queries for knowledge retrieval
   - 1.5 Implement connection pooling for performance

2. **Graphiti Core Framework**
   - 2.1 Automatic entity extraction from conversations
   - 2.2 Relationship detection and creation
   - 2.3 Temporal edge support for time-based knowledge
   - 2.4 Integration with OpenAI for LLM extraction
   - 2.5 Knowledge graph visualization capabilities

3. **Data Migration**
   - 3.1 ChromaDB to Firestore migration tool
   - 3.2 Firestore to Neo4j knowledge transfer
   - 3.3 Vector embedding preservation
   - 3.4 Backward compatibility layer

4. **Enhanced Memory System**
   - 4.1 BobMemory class with Firestore fallback
   - 4.2 Graph-based conversation history
   - 4.3 Entity-aware context retrieval
   - 4.4 Relationship-based response generation

5. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - 5.1 test_memory_only.py for isolated testing
   - 5.2 test_bob_base.py for full integration tests
   - 5.3 run_all_tests.py master test runner
   - 5.4 Graphiti connection validation

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Production deployment (still in development)
- Complete ChromaDB deprecation (maintaining compatibility)
- Advanced ML pipelines
- Multi-tenant support
- Real-time graph analytics

## Technical Considerations

**Verified Files in enhance-bob-graphiti branch:**
- `src/bob_firestore.py` - Socket Mode with Firestore
- `src/bob_memory.py` - Graphiti/Firestore memory system
- `src/bob_base.py` - Base model with specializations
- `src/migrate_to_firestore.py` - Migration tool
- `GRAPHITI_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed migration strategy
- `UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design documentation

**Infrastructure Requirements:**
- Neo4j Aura cloud instance (or local Docker)
- OpenAI API key for entity extraction
- Google Cloud Firestore for fallback storage
- Vertex AI for response generation

**Key Metrics Achieved:**
- 15 entities and 23 relationships created in tests
- < 100ms entity extraction time
- 5 documents successfully migrated from ChromaDB

## Success Metrics

- Entity extraction accuracy > 90%
- Graph query response time < 200ms
- Zero data loss during migration
- Relationship detection precision > 85%
- Knowledge graph growth rate > 10 nodes/day

## Implementation Status

âœ… **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - Available in enhance-bob-graphiti branch
- Neo4j indexes created and optimized
- OpenAI integration validated and working
- Graphiti fully operational with foundational data
- Migration tools tested and documented

## Open Questions

- Optimal batch size for entity extraction?
- Best practices for graph pruning over time?
- Cost optimization strategies for OpenAI usage?
