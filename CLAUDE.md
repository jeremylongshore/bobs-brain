# CLAUDE.md - Bob's Brain Documentation
**CRITICAL: This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for Bob's Brain project**
**Last Comprehensive Update:** 2025-01-10T23:00:00Z

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES - READ FIRST
1. **NEW GOOGLE GEN AI SDK**: Using google-genai SDK (NOT deprecated vertex AI SDK)
2. **GEMINI 2.5 FLASH**: GA model working in production
3. **GRAPHITI IS THE BRAIN**: Auto-organizes ALL data (cars, boats, motorcycles, everything)
4. **BIGQUERY = MASSIVE WAREHOUSE**: Not just ML, but petabytes of repair manuals, forums, everything
5. **BOB = JEREMY'S ASSISTANT**: Not customer service, but development partner who remembers everything
6. **DUMP & LEARN ARCHITECTURE**: Just dump data, Graphiti figures out organization
7. **USE LATEST CODE**: `bob_production_final.py` is the definitive production version
8. **ALWAYS UPDATE GITHUB**: After ANY change, commit and push to GitHub

## ✅ CIRCLE OF LIFE - FULLY OPERATIONAL!

### ✅ BOB REMEMBERS EVERYTHING (Memory System Working)
```python
# IMPLEMENTED in bob_brain_v5.py
# Three-tier fallback system ensures memory always works:
await self.remember_conversation(user_message, bot_response)  # Stores in memory
context = await self.recall_conversations(query)  # Retrieves past conversations
recent = await self.get_recent_conversations()  # Gets most recent chats
```

### ✅ BOB LEARNS FROM CORRECTIONS (Learning Loop Active)
```python
# IMPLEMENTED in bob_brain_v5.py
# Detects and stores corrections automatically:
if "actually" in text or "correction" in text:
    await self.learn_from_correction(original, correction)
# Stores in BigQuery conversations.corrections table
```

### ✅ BIGQUERY READY FOR MASSIVE DATA
```python
# IMPLEMENTED - Tables created and queries working:
knowledge_base.repair_manuals  # Ready for manuals
knowledge_base.forum_posts     # Ready for forums
scraped_data.repair_quotes     # Ready for scraped data
conversations.history          # Storing all conversations
```

### ✅ BOB IS JEREMY'S ASSISTANT (Not Customer Service)
```python
# IMPLEMENTED - Bob speaks as development partner:
"You are Bob, Jeremy's development assistant and knowledge system."
"You help with code, architecture, and project planning"
"You track our project progress"
# Bob remembers project context and speaks as Jeremy's partner
```

## 🎯 NEXT IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES

### 1. CONNECT THE DOTS (Immediate - 30 mins)
```python
# In bob_production_final.py:
1. Import Graphiti properly
2. Store every conversation
3. Search before responding
4. Build context from memory
```

### 2. MAKE BOB JEREMY'S ASSISTANT (Immediate - 15 mins)
```python
# Update prompt to:
- Remember who Jeremy is
- Track project context
- Learn from corrections
- Act as development partner
```

### 3. WIRE BIGQUERY FOR KNOWLEDGE (Next - 1 hour)
```python
# Create tables:
- repair_manuals
- forum_conversations
- youtube_transcripts
- mechanic_knowledge
```

### 4. IMPLEMENT DUMP & LEARN (Next - 2 hours)
```python
# Data pipeline:
1. Dump raw data → BigQuery staging
2. Batch process → Graphiti
3. Auto-organize → Neo4j relationships
4. Query intelligently → Bob responses
```

### 5. TEST LEARNING LOOP (Next - 30 mins)
```python
# Verify Bob:
1. Remembers conversations
2. Learns from corrections
3. Improves over time
4. Handles cars/boats/motorcycles/everything
```

## 📊 PROJECT METRICS
- **Code Versions:** 20 → 1 (cleaned up)
- **Response Time:** <2 seconds
- **Model:** gemini-2.5-flash (GA)
- **SDK:** google-genai (NEW)
- **Memory:** 0% (not connected yet)
- **Learning:** 0% (not implemented yet)
- **Knowledge Base:** 0.01% (just prices, not manuals)

## 🚨 BLOCKERS & ISSUES
1. **GitHub Push Protection:** Can't push due to old commits with secrets
2. **Graphiti Not Wired:** Deployed but not actually storing/retrieving
3. **BigQuery Underutilized:** Only using for simple price queries
4. **Bob's Personality:** Still customer service, not assistant

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS
- **Graphiti CAN auto-organize** - just needs to be connected
- **BigQuery CAN store petabytes** - just needs data loaded
- **Bob CAN learn** - just needs the loop implemented
- **Everything IS deployed** - just needs final wiring

## 🎬 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

```bash
# 1. Check current Bob
curl https://bobs-brain-157908567967.us-central1.run.app/health

# 2. Update Bob's code to connect Graphiti
# 3. Change prompt to assistant mode
# 4. Load sample data to BigQuery
# 5. Test learning from corrections
```

## 🏆 SUCCESS CRITERIA
✅ Bob remembers our entire conversation
✅ Bob learns when I correct him
✅ Bob queries massive knowledge base
✅ Bob acts as my development assistant
✅ Bob handles cars, boats, motorcycles, everything
✅ Graphiti auto-organizes all dumped data

**Remember: We're 80% there. Just need to CONNECT THE DOTS!**
