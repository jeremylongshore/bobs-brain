# CLAUDE.md - Bob's Brain Documentation
**CRITICAL: This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for Bob's Brain project**
**Last Comprehensive Update:** 2025-08-11T07:00:00Z (August 11, 2025, 7:00 AM UTC)

## üö® CRITICAL RULES - READ FIRST
1. **NEW GOOGLE GEN AI SDK**: Using google-genai SDK (NOT deprecated vertex AI SDK)
2. **GEMINI 2.5 FLASH**: GA model working in production
3. **GRAPHITI IS THE BRAIN**: Auto-organizes ALL data (cars, boats, motorcycles, everything)
4. **BIGQUERY = MASSIVE WAREHOUSE**: Not just ML, but petabytes of repair manuals, forums, everything
5. **BOB = JEREMY'S ASSISTANT**: Not customer service, but development partner who remembers everything
6. **DUMP & LEARN ARCHITECTURE**: Just dump data, Graphiti figures out organization
7. **USE LATEST CODE**: `bob_brain_v5.py` is the definitive production version
8. **ALWAYS UPDATE GITHUB**: After ANY change, commit and push to GitHub
9. **NO DIRECT COMMITS TO MAIN**: Use feature branches, enforced by pre-commit hooks

## üîî CRITICAL RUNTIME CONSTRAINTS
- **SINGLE CLOUD RUN RULE**: There should always only be one cloud run for bob and that is bobs brain no more no less one cloud run for bob, bobs brain

## üîÑ CIRCLE OF LIFE ARCHITECTURE
The Circle of Life is Bob's continuous learning ecosystem that connects MVP3 diagnostic data with Bob's Brain:

### Data Flow:
1. **MVP3** ‚Üí Customer submits problems ‚Üí Stored in Datastore
2. **Bob Ingests** ‚Üí Pulls from Datastore ‚Üí Learns patterns
3. **BigQuery ML** ‚Üí Stores patterns ‚Üí Analyzes trends
4. **Enhanced Responses** ‚Üí Bob provides better solutions
5. **Feedback Loop** ‚Üí Corrections improve accuracy

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /mvp3/submit-diagnostic` - Receive diagnostic problems
- `POST /mvp3/feedback` - Learn from corrections
- `GET /circle-of-life/metrics` - Monitor learning progress
- `POST /circle-of-life/ingest` - Manual data ingestion

## üö® CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES
**NEVER violate these rules - they prevent production disasters:**

### Git Workflow Rules:
1. **NEVER commit directly to main branch** - ALWAYS use: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. **NEVER use --no-verify flag** - It bypasses ALL safety checks
3. **ALWAYS run checks BEFORE committing:**
   - `make lint-check` - Code style compliance
   - `make test` - All tests must pass
   - `pre-commit run --all-files` - Execute all hooks
4. **ALWAYS use `make safe-commit`** - Ensures all checks pass
5. **FIX all errors BEFORE committing** - No exceptions

### Deployment Rules:
1. **TEST locally first** - Never deploy untested code
2. **CHECK health endpoint** - Verify all components after deploy
3. **MONITOR logs** - Watch for errors after deployment
4. **ROLLBACK if needed** - Keep previous working version ready

### AI Agent Safety:
1. **Verify guardrails** - Prevent unintended AI actions
2. **Use environment variables** - Never hardcode API keys
3. **Log agent behavior** - Track with tracing tools
4. **Monitor costs** - Prevent API overruns

- The Circle of Life enables continuous learning from ALL interactions
- Every diagnostic submission makes Bob smarter
- Datastore (not Firestore) is used for MVP3 compatibility
- Always follow development rules to prevent production issues

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

- **If Circle of Life errors:** Verify BigQuery permissions
- **If Datastore disconnects:** Check cross-project IAM roles
- **If deployment fails:** Review Dockerfile and dependencies
- **If tests fail:** Run locally first, check for missing deps
