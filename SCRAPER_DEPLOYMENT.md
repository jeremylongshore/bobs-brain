## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy to Cloud Run
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x deploy_scraper.sh

# Deploy scraper (builds container, deploys to Cloud Run, sets up scheduler)
./deploy_scraper.sh
```

### Step 2: Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check Cloud Run service
gcloud run services describe circle-of-life-scraper \
  --region us-central1 \
  --project bobs-house-ai

# Check scheduler job
gcloud scheduler jobs describe overnight-scraper \
  --location us-central1 \
  --project bobs-house-ai
```

### Step 3: Test Endpoints
```bash
# Get service URL
SERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe circle-of-life-scraper \
  --region us-central1 \
  --project bobs-house-ai \
  --format 'value(status.url)')

# Test health check
curl $SERVICE_URL/health

# Trigger test scrape (limited)
curl -X POST $SERVICE_URL/scrape \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"scrape_type":"test"}'

# Check today's insights (after scraping)
curl $SERVICE_URL/insights/today

# Search S740 knowledge
curl "$SERVICE_URL/search/s740?q=hydraulic"
```

## ‚è∞ Automatic Schedule

The scraper runs automatically every night at 2:00 AM CST:
- **2:00 AM** - Scraping starts
- **2:00-3:00 AM** - Forums scraped, data extracted
- **3:00-3:30 AM** - Patterns analyzed, knowledge updated
- **3:30 AM** - Daily report generated
- **Morning** - Fresh S740 knowledge available in Bob

## üìà What Happens Each Night

1. **Phase 1: Discovery (2:00 AM)**
   - Searches for new Bobcat S740 discussions
   - Discovers new forums and threads
   - Identifies valuable content

2. **Phase 2: Extraction (2:15 AM)**
   - Scrapes forum threads
   - Extracts problems and solutions
   - Identifies error codes and fixes
   - Captures equipment hacks

3. **Phase 3: Learning (2:45 AM)**
   - Analyzes patterns in problems
   - Ranks solution effectiveness
   - Updates knowledge confidence scores

4. **Phase 4: Integration (3:00 AM)**

## üîç Sample Data Collected

### Bobcat S740 Issues Found:
```json
{
  "problem_type": "hydraulic",
  "problem_description": "Lift arms drifting down when engine off",
  "solution": "Replace lift cylinder seals and check relief valve setting",
  "error_codes": ["H3933", "H3934"],
  "parts_needed": ["Seal kit 7135532", "Relief valve 6987452"],

}
```

## üéØ Expected Results

After first overnight run, Bob will have:
- **500+ Bobcat S740 specific issues and solutions**

- **1000+ general skid steer knowledge items**
- **Pattern recognition for common problems**
- **Cost estimates for repairs**
- **Part numbers and tools needed**

## üß™ Testing the Integration

### Test Bob's S740 Knowledge:
```python
# In Bob's Brain conversation
"Hey Bob, my Bobcat S740 has error code H3933"
# Bob will search S740 knowledge and provide specific solution

"What's the DPF regeneration procedure for S740?"
# Bob will provide maintenance schedule info

"How do I increase hydraulic flow on my S740?"
# Bob will share equipment hacks
```

## üìä Monitor Progress

### Check scraping history:
```sql
SELECT 
  scrape_id,
  start_time,
  end_time,
  forums_scraped,
  s740_issues_found,
  status
FROM `bobs-house-ai.circle_of_life.scraping_history`
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### View S740 knowledge growth:
```sql
SELECT 
  DATE(scraped_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as issues_found,
  COUNT(DISTINCT problem_type) as problem_types
FROM `bobs-house-ai.skidsteer_knowledge.bobcat_s740_issues`
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date DESC
```

## üö® Important Notes

1. **First Run:** The initial scraping may take 1-2 hours
2. **Rate Limiting:** Scraper respects site limits (1-2 second delays)
3. **Ethics:** Only scrapes public content, respects robots.txt
4. **Storage:** All data stored in BigQuery (free tier sufficient)
5. **Costs:** Cloud Run free tier covers overnight runs

## üéâ Success Indicators

Tomorrow morning, you should see:
1. ‚úÖ Scraping history entry showing "completed"
2. ‚úÖ 100+ new S740 issues in BigQuery
3. ‚úÖ Bob responding with S740-specific knowledge
4. ‚úÖ Daily insights report available
5. ‚úÖ Pattern recognition working

## üîß Troubleshooting

If scraping doesn't run:
1. Check Cloud Scheduler logs
2. Check Cloud Run logs
3. Verify service account permissions
4. Test manual trigger with curl
